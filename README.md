It's the eternal battle between day and night, good and bad. And now, you can bet on it!

## How to play

Each of the *teams* (white and blue) have their stocks. Price of 1 white stock is the number of white squares and same holds for black stocks. You can buy and sell stocks and try to make as much money as you can. 

Unlike the original version, starting positions are random here.
